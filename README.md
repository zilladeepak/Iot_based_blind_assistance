# IOT BASED BLIND ASSISTANCE
### Abstract
- Blindness is one of the more feared affliction in this evolving world. It is very difficult to
travel to a desired distance and to find the desired object which is present in front of the blind people.
Blind people relay on some people for their work to be done. On a daily basis, they struggle with
navigation. The usage of walking sticks has become customary for the same reason. Although, there
are a lot of limitation of just relying on a blind stick. A more suitable method is needed which
will alert the user about the obstacle and should also be of assistance in guiding the user to their
location. As per the above requirements we proposed a system that provides a virtual eye in the form
of smart stick to the blind people so that they can lead their own life without the help of the other
people. The proposed system is designed to detect obstacles using a combination of sensors including
Ultrasonic, Fire, Water, Temperature, and LDR. The system includes an Arduino Nano and a speaker
that produces an output sound alerting the user about the obstacles ahead.
- The integration of fire and water sensors is crucial in detecting potential hazards in the
userâ€™s path, such as a fire or water puddle, providing alerts through the speaker. Temperature sensors
identify the temperature of air in the surroundings, and LDRs detect changes in light levels. The
vibration motor provides additional feedback for obstacle detection. Overall, the proposed system is
a comprehensive solution that combines multiple sensors and a speaker to provide blind individuals
with a reliable and efficient way to navigate around their environment. It has the potential to greatly
improve their independence and quality of life, allowing them to move around with greater ease and
confidence.
